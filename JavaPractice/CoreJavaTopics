Java Fundamentals:
JDK, JVM, JRE, JIT(done)
How Java .java file is converted to .class file (Intermediary bytecode)(done)(done)
Role of Java classloader(done)
Why Java is platform-independent(done)
Why Java is not fully object-oriented(done)
Java is interpreted or compiled-language (clarification needed here, it's compiled to bytecode and then interpreted/JIT compiled)(done)
Data types in Java (Primitive, Non-primitive)(done)
(primitive types are basic pre-defined data types in java and non-primitive data types
are basically references , they can be both pre-defined like String and user-defined like Custom class.

How Java is pass by value (done)
How to make clone objects of Java - diff ways(Reflection)
Shallow copy vs Deep copy in Java(done)
Operators (done)
Wrapper classes (done)
Autoboxing, Unboxing(int to INTEGER, INTEGER to int)  (done)
Type Conversion - Widening or Implicit Conversion, Narrowing or Explicit Conversion(done)
main() method (psvm) (done)

Access Modifiers (done)
Java packages (java.util, java.lang, java.time, java.io, java.sql) (done)
Classes and Objects: (done)
Classes & Objects (done)
Abstract Class vs. Interface(Marker Interfaces)
Singleton class in Java(Eager Initialization and Lazy Initialization)(`Disadvantages and when to use) (done)
Java not supporting multiple inheritance through classes (done)
Object class in Java (done) - equals method needs to be overriden to update the comparison logic (done)
Inner class in Java (Member Inner Class, Method with a local Inner Class, static nested Inner Class)(done)
Anonymous class(done)

Strings:
Strings, Heap Memory, String Memory Pool(done)
Strings are immutable in nature How & Why(done) - Security, Thread Safety, Performance and caching(hashcodes) (done)
String vs. StringBuffer vs. StringBuilder
Immutable, StringJoiner

Arrays:
Arrays
Multi-dimensional array
Jagged Arrays

Constructors and Methods:
Construction, methods
Association and Relationships:
Association, Composition of Aggregation, IS-A, HAS-A Relation

Memory Management:
Memory Management (Heap Memory, Stack Memory, Local Variables, Object, Method Calls, Dynamic Object Reference)
Garbage Collector in Java (System.gc(), explicit GC call, Memory allocation - fixed memory (by JVM))
Memory Leaks in Java

Avoiding Memory Leaks:
Use WeakReference using WeakHashMap
Avoid using static variables
Use static nested class instead of non-static nested/inner class
Intern the strings
Use StringBuilder, StringBuffer
Be cautious with substring

Keywords:
final keyword, abstract keyword, super keyword
static keyword (Static class, Static method, Static block, Static nested class, can class be static)
final keyword vs final method vs finally vs final variables (can class be final on static final)
this keyword, enum keyword, transient keyword (helps in excluding sensitive or non-serializable data)

I/O and Serialization:
Scanner class vs BufferedReader class
Files in Java, File Handling in Java (File InputStream, FileOutputStream, BufferedReader InputStream, BufferedReader OutputStream)
Serialization/Deserialization
Java IO (same as 27 - referring to File Handling)

Flow Control and Regular Expressions:
Regular Expressions in Java
Flow Control in Java (if-else, for loop, for each, while loop, do-while loop, return, break, continue)
Collections and Generics:
Comparable, Comparator
Collections.sort() (List, Comparator)
compareTo (student.getname())
PERMGEN, METASPACE (Special class that represents a group of constants)
Enums are similar to a class
